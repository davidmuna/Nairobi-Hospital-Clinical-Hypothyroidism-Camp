# Nairobi-Hospital-Clinical-Hypothyroidism-Ensemble Classification Methods
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. The healthcare datasets provided will be used to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid using:

Part 1: Decision trees:
- For this section, I built a model that makes the above prediction. I used at least 2 out of the following 3 advanced models: Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.


Part 2: SVM:

- In this section, I cleaned the data a little bit so as to make sense of the features.

- Document what transformation you've done on the data.

- Applying Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel function to build my SVM model and then evaluate their performance and pick the kernel that performs the best. I tuned my parameters to improve the performance of my model. I visualized the models I created. 

I used decision trees to give me the most preferable features I can use. but also kept in mind that those features might not be suitable for SVM. So I to graphed them first.
